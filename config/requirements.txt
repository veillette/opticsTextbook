# Python dependencies for Optics Textbook
# Pin versions for reproducible builds (updated December 2025)
#
# NOTE: Most scripts have been converted to JavaScript (see CONVERSION_STATUS.md)
# Python is only required for:
#   - lint_myst_markdown.py (linting)
#   - validate_references_enhanced.py (validation)
#   - lint_equation_labels.py (equation checking)
#
# These scripts will be converted to JavaScript in future phases.

# standard library modules.
