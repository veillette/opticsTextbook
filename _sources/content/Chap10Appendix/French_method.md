# Algebraic Distance in Geometrical Optics


There exists a method to deal with the sign convention in geometrical optics which uses so-called algebraic distances. It is a matter of taste but this method which is mostly taught in France may be an interesting alternative to the convention used in Chapter 2.

## Definition
Let there be two points A and B in an affine space through which passes a directed line (a line with a direction, i.e. generated by a nonzero vector $\vec{v}$). We introduce the algebraic distance $\overline{AB}$ from A to B to be the real number such that :
1. its absolute value is the distance between A and B
2. if the value is non-zero:
3. $\overline{AB}$ is positive in the case the vector $\overrightarrow{\rm AB}$ has the same direction as $\vec{v}$, i.e. $\overrightarrow{\rm AB}= k\vec{v}$ with $k>0$;
4. $\overline{AB}$ is negative otherwise.


It follows that

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\overline{AB}=\dfrac{\overrightarrow{\rm AB}\cdot\vec{v}}{\Vert\vec{v}\Vert}
\end{align*}
```

Note that to define the algebraic distance, no choice for the origin is needed, only a vector that defines the direction of the line.

## Properties
The algebraic distance has the following properties:
- $\overline{AA}=0$,
- $\overline{AB}=-\overline{BA}$,
- for three points A, B and C all on the same line:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\overline{AC}=\overline{AB}+\overline{BC}
\end{align*}
```
irrespective of the position of B relative to A and C on the line.

The last point can can be shown using the analogous equality for vectors:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\overrightarrow{\rm AC}= \overrightarrow{\rm AB}+\overrightarrow{\rm BC}
\end{align*}
```

## Algebraic distance in Optics

When we use the algebraic distance in optics, we use the following conventions:
1. Light propagates from left to right;
2. The optical axis is positively oriented towards the right (i.e. in the direction the light propagates);
3. the vertical axis, perpendicular to the optical axis is positively oriented upwards.



```{figure} Images/Annexe/AO_Algebric_optics_def.png
:name: Fig_AO_04
Definition the different points in an optical system.
```


In {numref}`Fig_AO_04`, the definition of positive ray angle and positive radii of curvature are defined:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\overline{R_1}\equiv\overline{V_1C_1}>0, \mbox { and }
\overline{R_2}=\overline{V_2C_2}<0.
\end{align*}
```

## One Spherical Surface

Let us consider a spherical interface between two media with different index of refraction $n_1$ and $n_2$ as shown in {numref}`Fig_AO_08`. Let C be the center of the sphere and let V be the vertex, i.e. the point of intersection of the sphere and the optical axis.
One can show that for the image point $A_2$ of point $A_1$:

$$
\dfrac{n_2}{\overline{VA_2}}-\dfrac{n_1}{\overline{VA_1}}=\dfrac{n_2-n_1}{\overline{VC}}=V,
$$ (eq_dioptre)

and that the transverse magnification can be written as:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
M=\dfrac{\overline{VA_2}}{n_2}.\dfrac{n_1}{\overline{VA_1}}.
\end{align*}
```

If the object is at infinity $A_2=F_2$ is the image focal point and

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{n_2}{\overline{VF_2}}=\dfrac{n_2-n_1}{\overline{VC}}=P,
\end{align*}
```
where $P$ is the power of the surface.
If the image is at the infinity, $A_1=F_1$ is the object focal point and

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{n_1}{\overline{VF_1}}=-\dfrac{n_2-n_1}{\overline{VC}}=-P
\end{align*}
```


```{figure} Images/Annexe/AO_Algebric_optics_dioptre.png
:name: Fig_AO_08
Spherical surface separating two different media.
```


When the interface is flat: $\overline{VC}\rightarrow \infty$, we get

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{n_2}{\overline{VA_2}}=\dfrac{n_1}{\overline{VA_1}}
\end{align*}
```

We can easily rewrite the Eq. {eq}`eq_dioptre` as function of the center instead of the summit by exchanging V with C and $n_1$ with $n_2$:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{n_1}{\overline{CA_2}}-\dfrac{n_2}{\overline{CA_1}}=\dfrac{n_1-n_2}{\overline{CV}}
\end{align*}
```
and for the transverse magnification:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
M=\dfrac{\overline{CA_2}}{\overline{CA_1}}
\end{align*}
```

The last relation is usually called the relation of Descartes and put in relation $F_1$ and $F_2$ with the vertex:

```{math}
:label: eq_rel_descartes
\begin{align*}
\frac{\overline {VF_2}}{\overline {VA_2}}+{\frac {\overline {VF_1}}{\overline {VA_1}}}=1
\end{align*}
```

```


The relation of Newton is an other way to link the position of the object and the one of the image via the focal points:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\overline{F_2A_2} \cdot \overline{F_1A_1} = \overline{VF_2} \cdot \overline{VF_1}
\end{align*}
```
## Mirror

For the mirror, we define $V$ as the vertex (the meeting point between the mirror and the optical axis), $C$ the center of the curvature and $F$ the focal point as show in {numref}`Fig_AO_07`. For a concave mirror $\overline{VC}=2\overline{VF}<0$ and for the convex mirror, $\overline{VC}=2\overline{VF}>0$.

```

:name: Fig_AO_07

```


If a point A is placed on the right of the mirror, i.e. $\overline{VA}>0$, the point is consider virtual. Be aware that if you look at the mirror yourself, you will be able to "image" this virtual point. To convince yourself, just use a spoon.

We can derive the law of conjugation the works for any spherical mirror independent on its curvature:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{1}{\overline{VA_i}}+\dfrac{1}{\overline{VA_o}}=\dfrac{2}{\overline{VC}}
\end{align*}
```

The magnification can also be derived:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
M&\equiv\dfrac{\overline{A_iB_i}}{\overline{A_oB_o}}\\
&=\dfrac{\overline{FV}}{\overline{FA_o}}=\dfrac{\overline{FA_i}}{\overline{FV}}=-\dfrac{\overline{VA_i}}{\overline{VA_o}}
\end{align*}
```

As we have done earlier, we can rewrite these equations with center instead of the summit:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{1}{\overline{CA_i}}+\dfrac{1}{\overline{CA_o}}=\dfrac{2}{\overline{CV}}
\end{align*}
```
The magnification can also be derived with C as origin:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
M&\equiv\dfrac{\overline{A_iB_i}}{\overline{A_oB_o}}\\
&=\dfrac{\overline{CA_i}}{\overline{CA_o}}
\end{align*}
```

## Spherical lens
Spherical lenses are made of glass and are bounded by two spherical surfaces of curvature $\overline{R_1} = \overline{C_1V_1}$ and $\overline{R_2} = \overline{C_2V_2}$, with centers $C_1$ and $C_2$ and vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$ respectively. When $\overline{R_1}>0$ and $\overline{R_2}<0$, the lens is biconvex; when $\overline{R_2}>0$ and $\overline{R_1}<0$ it is biconcave. They are thin when the distance ($V_1V_2$) is very small compared to the radii of curvature $R_1$ and $R_2$.

## Thin spherical lens
When considering a thin spherical lens, we define 3 points $O$, $F_o$ and $F_i$, respectively the center of the lens, the focal object point and focal image point. As shown in {numref}`Fig_AO_14`, we can say:
- $F_o$ is the point from which all rays hand up parallel to the optical axis when exiting the lens are originating;\\
- $F_i$ is the point were all the rays parallel to the optical axis coming towards the lens converges to.


```{figure} Images/Annexe/AO_Algebric_optics_positive_lens.png
:name: Fig_AO_14

```


The **image focal length** $f_i$ of a lens is defined as the algebraic quantity :

```{math}
\begin{align*}
f_i\equiv\overline{OF_i}=-\overline{OF_o}=f_o
\end{align*}
```
while we also introduce the **object focal length** $f_o$.
- In the case of a positive lens, the image focal distance $f_i$ is positive, i.e. $\overline{OF_i}>0$ and $\overline{OF_o}<0$.
- In the case of a negative lens, the image focal distance $f_i$ is negative, i.e. $\overline{OF_i}>0$


The algebraic quantity called the **diopter** $\cal{D}$  of a thin lens is:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\cal{D}&\equiv\dfrac{1}{\overline{OF_i}}=(1-n)\left(\dfrac{1}{\overline{V_2C_2}}-\dfrac{1}{\overline{V_1C_1}}\right)
\end{align*}
```
where $n$ is the index of refraction of the glass.

For any lens system defined with $F_i$ as the image focal point, we now only have one equation which is always valid:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{1}{\overline{OF_i}}=\dfrac{1}{\overline{OA_i}}-\dfrac{1}{\overline{OA_o}}
\end{align*}
```
where the point $A_i$ is image of the point $A_o$ through the lens. Notice that we do not need to know where $A_o$ is with regards to the lens to write the formula nor if we deal with a positive lens. If in your calculation you find for example that $\overline{OA_i}<0$ then you know that the image is virtual.

We can also define the magnification as:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
M\equiv\dfrac{\overline{A_iB_i}}{\overline{A_oB_o}}=\dfrac{\overline{OA_i}}{\overline{OA_o}}
\end{align*}
```
where the point $B_i$ is the image of the object point $B_o$. The sign of $M$ will automatically give you if the image is inverted or not.

{numref}`Fig_AO_06` shows the case where the image is inverted compare to the object where $\overline{OA_i}$ is positive and $\overline{OA_o}$ is negative.
