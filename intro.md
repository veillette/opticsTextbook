# Open textbooks with Jupyter books

This "How-To" Manual is meant as an explanation and working example of the possibilities of making an online open textbook with the Jupyter books software.

Welcome to the Jupyter Book template for TU Delft! This template is designed to make it easy for professors to create their own custom textbooks, lecture notes, or other educational materials for their courses.

With Jupyter Book, you can write your content using Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, etc., and easily organize it into chapters and sections. You can also add interactive elements like code snippets, visualizations, and quizzes to engage your students and enhance their learning experience.

Whether you're creating a textbook from scratch or adapting existing materials, this template provides a solid starting point and customization options to fit your needs. We hope you find it useful and look forward to seeing the great educational resources you'll create with it!
