    "This chapter is about Maxwell's equations and is a prerequisite for the rest of the book. It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with electromagnetism at the bachelor level. Therefore the treatments of Maxwell's equations in matter, boundary conditions at interfaces, electromagnetic energy, the field of an electric dipole and the reflection and transmission at an interface are rather concise.\n",

    "After studying this chapter you should know and be able to\n",
    "- Derive the scalar wave equation for the electromagnetic field components from Maxwell's equations.\n",
    "- Work with the complex notation of time harmonic fields.\n",
    "- Understand time harmonic plane waves, spherical waves and the concept of wave fronts.\n",
    "- Know the main properties of the field radiated by a time-harmonic electric dipole and understand that it is the fundamental solution of Maxwell's equations from which the radiation of any time-harmonic source can be derived.\n",
    "- Qualitatively understand the far field radiation pattern of a time-harmonic electric dipole (you do not need to know the formulas).\n",
    "- Derive long-time averages of products of time-harmonic functions.\n",
    "- Compute the rate of energy flow using the Poynting vector and its long-time average. The derivation of the law of conservation of electromagnetic energy is not part of the exam.\n",
    "- Understand the method of deriving the reflection and transmission of an incident plane wave at an interface by separating in s- and p-polarized states.\n",

    "Maxwell's equations provide a very complete description of light which includes diffraction, interference and polarisation. Yet it is strictly speaking not fully accurate, because it allows monochromatic electromagnetic waves to carry any amount of energy, whereas according to quantum optics the energy is quantised. According to quantum optics, light is a flow of massless particles, the photons, which each carry an extremely small quantum of energy: $\\hbar\\omega$, where $\\hbar = 6.63 \\times 10^{-34}/(2\\pi)$ Js and $\\omega$ is the frequency, which for visible light is of the order $5 \\times 10^{14}$ Hz. Hence for visible light $\\hbar\\omega \\approx 3.3\\times {10^{-19}}$ J.\n",

    "Quantum optics is only important in experiments involving a small number of photons, i.e. at very low light intensities and for specially prepared photons states (e.g. entangled states) for which there is no classical description.

    "In a vacuum, light is described by vector fields $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{E}}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ [Volt/m]<sup>[^1]</sup> and $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{B}}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ [Tesla=Weber/$\\text{m}^2$=g/(C.s)], which vary extremely rapidly with the position vector $\\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$.\n",
    "These vector fields are traditionally called the electric field strength and the magnetic induction, respectively, and together they are referred to as \"the electromagnetic field\". This terminology is explained by the fact that, because in optics these fields vary with time, the electric and magnetic fields always occur together, i.e. one does not exist without the other. Only when the fields are independent of time, there can be an electric field without a magnetic field and conversely. The first case is called electrostatics, the second magnetostatics.\n",
    "Time-dependent electromagnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, the so-called sources. Let the source have charge density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r},t)$ [C/$\\text{m}^3$] and current density $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{J}}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ [C/(s.$\\text{m}^2$].

    "In {numref}`Fig_1_09_Field_lines_Radiating_Dipole` are drawn the electric and magnetic field lines of a radiating dipole. For an observer at large distance from the dipole, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of the line of sight $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$ from the dipole to the observer. Furthermore, the electric field is in the plane through the dipole vector $\\mathbf{p}$ and the vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$, while the magnetic field is perpendicular to this plane. So, for a distant observer the dipole field is similar to that of a plane wave which propagates from the dipole towards the observer and has an electric field parallel to the plane through the dipole and the line of sight $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$ and perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields depend on the direction of the line of sight, with the field vanishing when the line of sight $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$ is parallel to the dipole vector $\\mathbf{p}$ and with maximum amplitude when $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}$ is in the plane perpendicular to the dipole vector.

    "Optical frequencies are in the range of $5 \\times 10^{14}$ Hz and the fastest detectors working at optical frequencies have integration times larger than $10^{-10}$ s. Hence there is no detector which can measure the time fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields at optical frequencies and any detector always measures an average value, taken over an interval of time that is very large compared to the period $2\\pi/\\omega$ of the light wave, typically at least a factor $10^5$ longer. We therefore compute averages over such time intervals of the Poynting vector and of the electromagnetic energy. Because the Poynting vector and energy density depend nonlinearly (quadratically) on the field amplitudes, we can *not* perform the computations using the complex amplitudes and take the real part afterwards, but have instead to start from the real quantities.

    "Since visible light has such high frequencies (order $10^{15}$ Hz), roughly a hundred thousand times more information can be carried through a fiber than at microwave frequencies. Today fibers with very low losses are fabricated so that signals can be sent around the earth with hardly any attenuation. Abraham van Heel, professor of optics at Delft University of Technology, showed for the first time in a paper published in Nature in 1954<sup>[^7]</sup> that by packing thousands of fibers into a cable, images can be transferred, even if the bundle is bent ({numref}`Fig_2_13_Laser_Glass` bottom).\n",
