    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this chapter we will study how light propagates as a wave. In the study of the double-slit experiment we concluded from the interference pattern observed on a screen that light is a wave. To demonstrate more convincingly that light is indeed a wave, we require a detailed quantitative model of the propagation of light, which gives experimentally verifiable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a precise description of the propagation of light is not only important for fundamental science, it also has many practical applications. For example, if a sample must be analysed by illuminating it and measuring the scattered light, the fact that the detected light has not only been affected by the sample, but by both the sample and propagation has to be taken into account. Another example is lithography. If a pattern has to be printed onto a substrate using a mask that is illuminated and there is a certain distance between the mask and the photoresist, the light which reaches the resist does not have the exact shape of the mask due to propagation effects. Thus, the mask needs to be designed to compensate for these effects.\n",

    "## Intuition for the Spatial Fourier Transform in Optics\n",
    "\n",
    "Since spatial Fourier transformations play an important role in our discussion of the propagation of light, it is important to understand them not just mathematically, but also intuitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when an object is illuminated and the reflected or transmitted light is detected at some distance from the object? Let us look at transmission for example. When the object is much larger than the wavelength, a transmission function $\\tau(x,y)$ is often defined and the field transmitted by the object is then assumed to be simply the product of the incident field and the function $\\tau(x,y)$. For example, for a hole in a metallic screen with diameter large compared to the wavelength, the transmission function would be 1 inside the hole and 0 outside. However, if the object has features of the size of the order of the wavelength, this simple model of multiplying by a transmission function breaks down and the transmitted field must instead be determined by solving Maxwell's equations. This is not easy, but some software packages can do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that the transmitted electric field has been obtained in a plane $z=0$ very close to the object (a distance within a fraction of a wavelength). This field is called the **transmitted near field** and it may have been obtained by simply multiplying the incident field with a transmission function $\\tau(x,y)$ or by solving Maxwell's equations. This transmitted near field is a kind of footprint of the object.\n",
    "But it should be clear that, although it is quite common in optics to speak in terms of \"imaging an object\", strictly speaking we do not image an object as such, but we image the transmitted or reflected near fields which are a kind of copy of the object.\n",
    "After the transmitted near field has been obtained, we apply the angular spectrum method to propagate the individual plane waves through homogeneous matter (e.g. air) from the object to the detector plane or to an optical element like a lens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $U_0(x,y)=U(x,y,0)$ be a component of the transmitted near field.\n",
    "The first step is to Fourier transform it, by which the field component is decomposed in plane waves.\n",
    "To each plane wave, characterised by the wave numbers $k_x$ and $k_y$, the Fourier transform assigns a complex amplitude\n",
    "$\\mathcal{F}(U_0)\\left(\\frac{k_x}{2\\pi},\\frac{k_y}{2\\pi}\\right)$, the magnitude of which indicates how important the role is which this particular wave plays in the formation of the near field. So what can be said about the object field $U_0(x,y)$,\n",
    "by looking at the magnitude of its spatial Fourier transform $|\\mathcal{F}(U_0)\\left(\\frac{k_x}{2\\pi},\\frac{k_y}{2\\pi}\\right)|$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $U_0(x,y)$ has sharp features, i.e. there are regions where $U_0(x,y)$ varies rapidly as a function of $x$ and $y$. To describe these features as a combination of plane waves, these waves must also vary rapidly as a function of $x$ and $y$, which means that the length of their wave vectors $\\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$ must be large. Thus, the sharper the features that $U_0(x,y)$ has, the larger we can expect\n",
    "$|\\mathcal{F}(U_0)\\left(\\frac{k_x}{2\\pi},\\frac{k_y}{2\\pi}\\right)|$ to be for large $\\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$, i.e. high spatial frequencies can be expected to have large amplitude. Similarly, the slowly varying, broad features of $U_0(x,y)$ are described by slowly fluctuating waves, i.e. by\n",
    "$\\mathcal{F}(U_0)\\left(\\frac{k_x}{2\\pi},\\frac{k_y}{2\\pi}\\right)$ for small $\\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$, i.e. for low spatial frequencies. This is illustrated in {numref}`Fig_6_04_Spatial_Fourier_Transform`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate these concepts further we choose a certain field, take its Fourier transform, remove the higher spatial frequencies and then invert the Fourier transform. We then expect that the resulting field has lost its sharp features and only retains its broad features, i.e. the image is blurred. Conversely, if we remove the lower spatial frequencies but retain the higher, then the result will only show its sharp features, i.e. its contours. These effects are shown in {numref}`Fig_6_05_FourierFilter`.\n",
    "Recall that when $k_x^2+k_y^2 > \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2$, the plane wave decays exponentially as the field propagates. Because by propagation through homogeneous space, the information contained in the high spatial frequencies corresponding to evanescent waves is lost (only exponentially small amplitudes of the evanescent waves remain), perfect imaging is impossible, no matter how well-designed an optical system is.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Propagation of light leads to irrecoverable loss of resolution.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this fact that motivates near-field microscopy, which tries to detect these evanescent waves by scanning close to the sample, thus obtaining subwavelength resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have seen how we can guess properties of some object field $U_0(x,y)$ given the amplitude of its spatial Fourier transform $|\\mathcal{F}(U_0)\\left(\\frac{k_x}{2\\pi},\\frac{k_y}{2\\pi}\\right)|$. But what about the phase of $\\mathcal{F}(U_0)\\left(\\frac{k_x}{2\\pi},\\frac{k_y}{2\\pi}\\right)$? Although one cannot really guess properties of $U_0(x,y)$ by looking at the phase of $\\mathcal{F}(U_0)\\left(\\frac{k_x}{2\\pi},\\frac{k_y}{2\\pi}\\right)$ the same way as we can by looking at its amplitude, it is in fact the phase that plays a larger role in defining $U_0(x,y)$. This is illustrated in {numref}`Fig_6_06_FourierPhase`: if the amplitude information of $\\mathcal{F}(U_0)\\left(\\frac{k_x}{2\\pi},\\frac{k_y}{2\\pi}\\right)$ is removed, features of the original $U_0(x,y)$ may still be retrieved. However, if we only know the amplitude $|\\mathcal{F}(U_0)(k_x,k_y)|$ but not the phase, then the original object is completely lost. Thus, the phase of a field $\\mathcal{F}(U_0)$ is very important, arguably often more important than its amplitude. However, we cannot measure the phase of a field directly, only its intensity $I=|\\mathcal{F}(U_0)|^2$ from which we can calculate the amplitude $|\\mathcal{F}(U_0)|$. It is this fact that makes **phase retrieval** an entire field of study on its own: how can we find the phase of a field, given that we can only perform intensity measurements? This question is related to a new field of optics called \"lensless imaging\", where amplitudes and phases are retrieved from intensity measurements and the image is reconstructed **computationally**. Interesting as this topic may be, we will not treat it in these notes and refer instead to master courses in optics <sup>[^3]</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark**. The importance of the phase for the field can also be seen by looking at the plane wave expansion {eq}`eq.planewave1`. We have seen that the field in a plane $z=\\text{constant}$ can be obtained by propagating the plane waves by multiplying their amplitudes by the phase factors $\\exp(i z k_z)$, which depends on the propagation distance $z$. If one leaves the evanescent waves out of consideration (since after some distance they hardly contribute to the field anyway), it follows that only the phases of the plane waves change upon propagation, while their amplitudes (the moduli of their complex amplitudes) do not change. Yet, depending on the propagation distance $z$, widely differing light patterns are obtained (see e.g. {numref}`Fig_6_08_FresnelFraunhoferSlit`).\n",

    "\n",
    "The integral in the Fresnel approximation for the field of a rectangular aperture in a mask can be computed analytically and leads to functions that are actually called \"Fresnel integrals\" which can be studied using the Cornu spirals. We will not go deeper in this matter but simply show the results of the simulations in\n",
    "{numref}`Fig_6_08_FresnelFraunhoferSlit`. The distance to the mask increases ($N_F$ decreases), from very close to the mask at the bottom right, to further from the mask at the bottom left, to rather far from the mask in the upper right, to Fraunhofer distance in the upper left figures. Note the change in scale along the axis in the figures and the decrease of intensity with propagation distance. It is seen that the pattern changes and broadens drastically with distance from what is more or less a copy of the aperture, to a patterns that is equal to the Fourier transform of the aperture. Once the Fraunhofer approximation is accurate, a further increase of distance only results in a widening of the pattern and a decrease of overall amplitude without change of shape. In contrast, in the region where the Fresnel approximation is accurate, the shape of the pattern is seen to change a lot with distance to the mask.\n",

    "It was furthermore explained that when only paraxial rays are considered, i.e. within Gaussian geometrical optics, perfect imaging of extended objects *is* possible. However, rays of which the angle with the optical axis is large cause aberrations. But even when perfect imaging would be possible in geometrical optics, a real image can never be perfect due to the fact that information contained in the amplitudes and phase of the evanescent waves cannot propagate.\n",
    "The resolution that can be obtained with an optical system consisting of lenses is less than follows from considering the loss of information due to evanescent waves, because propagating waves with spatial frequencies that are too large to be captured by the optical system (i.e. waves of which the angles with the optical axis are larger than the numerical aperture) cannot contribute to the image.

    "The size of the image of a point as given by the PSF in {eq}`eq.PSF` is influenced by the magnification of the system. To characterise the resolution of a diffraction-limited system, it is therefore better to consider the numerical aperture on the object side: $\\textit{NA}_o = \\textit{NA}_i |M| = a/s_o$. The value of $\\textit{NA}_o$ is the sinus of the half angle of the cone subtended by the entrance pupil of the system on the object point on the optical axis. This is the cone of wave vectors emitted by this object point that can contribute to the image (they are \"accepted\" by the optical system). The larger the half angle of this cone, the more spatial frequencies can contribute to the image and hence the larger the information about finer details of the object that can reach the image plane.\n",

The higher resolution is achieved thanks to the illumination by oblique plane waves that are present in the spatial Fourier transform of the illuminating spot. By illumination with plane waves with large angles of incidence, higher spatial frequencies of the object which under normal incidence are not accepted by the objective, are now ''folded back'' into the cone of plane waves accepted by the objective.

Therefore these media are called negative index media. Because the phase velocity is opposite to the energy velocity, it is as if time is reversed inside the slab.

    "The simple slab geometry seen in {numref}`Fig_6_19_Pendry_Lens` which acts as a perfect lens was proposed by John Pendry in 2000 <sup>[^10]</sup>. Unfortunately, a material with negative permittivity and negative permeability has not been found in nature. Therefore, many researchers have attempted to mimic such a material by mixing metals and dielectrics on a sub-wavelength scale. It seems that a negative index without absorption violates causality. But when there is absorption, the image is not anymore perfect.\n",

    "- **Hyperbolic materials.** Hyperbolic materials are anisotropic, i.e. the phase velocity of a plane wave depends on the polarisation and on the direction of the wave vector. The permittivity of an anisotropic material is a tensor (loosely speaking a (3,3)-matrix). Normally the eigenvalues of the permittivity matrix are positive; however, in a hyperbolic material two eigenvalues are of equal sign and the third has opposite sign. In such a medium all waves with the so-called extraordinary state of polarisation propagate, no matter how high the spatial frequencies are. Hence, for the extraordinary state of polarisation evanescent waves do not exist and therefore super-resolution and perfect imaging should be possible in such a medium.\n",

    "A few natural hyperbolic media exist for visible frequencies, but there are more in the mid-infrared. Researchers try to approximate hyperbolic media by metamaterials, made e.g. multilayers consisting of alternating thin metallic and dielectric layers, so that the effective permittivity has the desired hyperbolic property. Also metallic nanopilars embedded in a dielectric are used.\n",

    "- **Nonlinear effects.** When the refractive index of a material depends on the local electric field, the material is nonlinear. At optical frequencies nonlinear effects are in general very small, but with a strong laser they can become significant. One effect is self-focusing, where the refractive index is proportional to the local light intensity. The locally higher intensity causes an increase of the refractive index, leading to a waveguiding effect due to which the beam focuses even more strongly. Hence the focused beam becomes more and more narrow while propagating, until finally the material breaks down.\n",

    "- **Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy (STED).** This technique was invented by V. A. Okhonin in 1986 in the USSR and was further developed by Stefan Hell and his co-workers in the nineties. Hell received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in 2014. STED is a non-linear technique with which super-resolution in fluorescence microscopy can be achieved. Images made with a fluorescence microscope are blurred when the fluorescent molecules are very close together. In the STED microscope a special trick is used to ensure that molecules which fluoresce at the same time are sufficiently distant from each other so that they can be imaged individually. To achieve this two focused spots are used: the first spot excites the molecules to a higher level. The second spot is slightly red-shifted and has a doughnut shape (see {numref}`Fig_6_21_STED_Small`). It causes decay of the excited molecules to the lower level by stimulated emission (the excited state is depleted). Because of the doughnut shape of the second spot, the molecule in the centre of the spot is not affected and will still fluoresce. Crucial is that a doughnut spot has a central dark region which is very narrow, i.e. it can be much smaller than the Airy spot and this is the reason for the super-resolution.\n",
