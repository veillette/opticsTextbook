# Search & Navigation Guide

This guide will help you effectively search and navigate through this optics textbook to find the information you need quickly.

## Full-Text Search

This textbook includes a powerful full-text search feature that indexes all content, including:
- Chapter text and explanations
- Mathematical equations and formulas
- Figure captions and descriptions
- Problem sets and exercises
- Appendices and reference material

### Using the Search Function

1. **Access the search**: Look for the search icon (🔍) or search box in the top navigation bar
2. **Enter your query**: Type at least 2 characters to begin searching
3. **Review results**: Search returns up to 20 most relevant results
4. **Navigate to content**: Click on any result to jump directly to that section

### Search Tips

#### Basic Searching
- **Keywords**: Search for any keyword (e.g., "diffraction", "lens", "polarization")
- **Phrases**: Use quotes for exact phrases (e.g., "Snell's law")
- **Multiple terms**: Combine terms to narrow results (e.g., "Gaussian beam laser")

#### Mathematical Search
You can search for mathematical concepts:
- **Equations**: "wave equation", "Maxwell equations"
- **Symbols**: "wavelength", "refractive index", "Planck constant"
- **Notation**: Search for Greek letters by name (e.g., "lambda", "omega")
- **Formulas**: "photon energy", "focal length equation"

#### Topic-Based Search
Search by specific optical topics:
- **Phenomena**: "interference", "total internal reflection", "chromatic aberration"
- **Instruments**: "telescope", "microscope", "spectrometer"
- **Materials**: "fiber optics", "crystal", "birefringent"
- **Technologies**: "laser", "holography", "waveguide"

#### Advanced Search Techniques
- **Combine keywords**: "double slit interference" finds content about double-slit experiments
- **Use specific terms**: "Fabry-Perot" is more specific than "interference"
- **Search by chapter**: Include chapter name to narrow scope (e.g., "diffraction Fraunhofer")
