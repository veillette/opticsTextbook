# Appendix A: Complex Numbers in Optics

```{epigraph}
"God made the integers, all the rest is the work of man."

-- Leopold Kronecker
```

```{note}
While Kronecker may have dismissed complex numbers as artificial constructs, they have become absolutely essential in physics and engineering. In optics, complex numbers aren't just mathematical conveniences—they reveal deep physical insights about wave phenomena that would be nearly impossible to see otherwise.
```

Complex numbers provide one of the most elegant and powerful mathematical frameworks in all of optics. Far from being abstract mathematical curiosities, they offer profound insights into the nature of light itself. This appendix will guide you through the essential concepts, starting from the very basics and building toward sophisticated applications that illuminate the behavior of electromagnetic waves.

## A.1 What Are Complex Numbers and Why Do We Need Them?

### A.1.1 The Historical Motivation

```{margin}
The term "imaginary" is unfortunately misleading—these numbers are just as "real" as any other mathematical concept. The name stuck from historical prejudice, but modern physicists and engineers know that complex numbers describe very real phenomena.
```

Complex numbers emerged from a simple but frustrating problem: what is $\sqrt{-1}$? For centuries, mathematicians considered this question meaningless. But in the 16th century, while solving cubic equations, Italian mathematicians discovered that even when seeking real solutions, intermediate steps often required manipulating square roots of negative numbers.

Rather than dismiss these expressions as nonsensical, they began treating $\sqrt{-1}$ as a new kind of number, eventually denoted by $i$ (from "imaginary"). This bold step opened up an entirely new mathematical universe—one that turns out to perfectly describe oscillatory phenomena like light waves.

### A.1.2 Definition and Basic Structure

A complex number $z$ has the general form:

$$z = a + bi$$

where $a$ and $b$ are ordinary real numbers, and $i$ is the **imaginary unit** defined by the fundamental property:

$$i^2 = -1$$

```{important}
The real part $a = \text{Re}(z)$ and imaginary part $b = \text{Im}(z)$ are both real numbers. The "imaginary" part isn't imaginary in the colloquial sense—it's a perfectly concrete mathematical quantity.
```

Let's explore what this means through some examples:

```{admonition} Example A.1: Understanding Complex Number Components
Consider the complex number $z = 3 + 4i$.
- The real part is $\text{Re}(z) = 3$
- The imaginary part is $\text{Im}(z) = 4$ (note: not $4i$, just $4$)
- This represents a specific point in our extended number system
```

### A.1.3 Arithmetic Operations

Complex numbers follow familiar arithmetic rules, with one key difference: we must remember that $i^2 = -1$.

**Addition and Subtraction:**
Complex numbers add component-wise, just like vectors:
$$(a + bi) \pm (c + di) = (a \pm c) + (b \pm d)i$$

This makes intuitive sense: real parts combine with real parts, imaginary parts with imaginary parts.

**Multiplication:**
Here's where things get interesting. Using the distributive property and $i^2 = -1$:
$$(a + bi)(c + di) = ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$$

```{admonition} Example A.2: Complex Multiplication
Let's multiply $(2 + 3i)(1 + 4i)$:
- First terms: $2 \times 1 = 2$
- Outer terms: $2 \times 4i = 8i$
- Inner terms: $3i \times 1 = 3i$
- Last terms: $3i \times 4i = 12i^2 = -12$
- Result: $2 + 8i + 3i - 12 = -10 + 11i$
```

**Complex Conjugate:**
The complex conjugate of $z = a + bi$ is $z^* = a - bi$. This operation flips the sign of the imaginary part and has profound importance in physics—it's how we extract physically meaningful quantities from complex expressions.

```{note}
The complex conjugate has a beautiful geometric interpretation: it reflects the complex number across the real axis. More importantly for physics, when we multiply a complex number by its conjugate, we always get a real, non-negative result: $z \cdot z^* = |z|^2$.
```

### A.1.4 Geometric Representation: The Complex Plane

```{figure} #complex-plane-fig
:name: complex-plane
:align: center

The complex plane representation of several complex numbers. Each point represents a complex number, with the horizontal axis showing the real part and vertical axis showing the imaginary part.
```

One of the most illuminating ways to understand complex numbers is through their geometric representation in the **complex plane**. This is a coordinate system where:
- The horizontal axis represents the real part
- The vertical axis represents the imaginary part
- Each complex number $z = a + bi$ corresponds to the point $(a, b)$

This geometric view immediately reveals why complex numbers are so powerful for describing rotations and oscillations—operations that are fundamental to understanding waves.

### A.1.5 Polar Form: Magnitude and Phase

Every complex number can be expressed in **polar form**, which separates its magnitude from its direction:

$$z = r e^{i\theta} = r(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)$$

where:
- $r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ is the **magnitude** or **modulus**
- $\theta = \arg(z) = \arctan(b/a)$ is the **argument** or **phase**

```{admonition} Example A.3: Converting to Polar Form
For $z = 3 + 4i$:
- Magnitude: $r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5$
- Phase: $\theta = \arctan(4/3) \approx 0.927$ radians or about $53.1°$
- Polar form: $z = 5e^{i \cdot 0.927}$
```

The polar form is particularly powerful because:
1. **Multiplication** becomes addition of phases: $r_1 e^{i\theta_1} \cdot r_2 e^{i\theta_2} = r_1 r_2 e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}$
2. **Powers** become simple: $(re^{i\theta})^n = r^n e^{in\theta}$
3. **Physical meaning** emerges: $r$ represents amplitude, $\theta$ represents phase

## A.2 Euler's Formula: The Bridge Between Exponentials and Trigonometry

### A.2.1 The Most Beautiful Equation in Mathematics

```{epigraph}
"Euler's formula reaches down into the very depths of existence."

-- Keith Devlin, mathematician
```

**Euler's formula** stands as one of the most remarkable discoveries in mathematics:

$$e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta$$

This equation creates a bridge between three seemingly unrelated mathematical concepts: exponential functions, trigonometry, and complex numbers. But why is this true, and why should we care?

### A.2.2 Understanding Why Euler's Formula Works

```{dropdown} Mathematical Proof Using Taylor Series
The proof relies on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential and trigonometric functions:

$$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \cdots$$

$$\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots$$

$$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots$$

Now substitute $x = i\theta$ into the exponential series:
$$e^{i\theta} = 1 + i\theta + \frac{(i\theta)^2}{2!} + \frac{(i\theta)^3}{3!} + \frac{(i\theta)^4}{4!} + \cdots$$

Using the pattern $i^1 = i$, $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, $i^5 = i$, ...:
$$e^{i\theta} = 1 + i\theta - \frac{\theta^2}{2!} - i\frac{\theta^3}{3!} + \frac{\theta^4}{4!} + i\frac{\theta^5}{5!} - \cdots$$

Grouping real and imaginary terms:
$$e^{i\theta} = \left(1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2!} + \frac{\theta^4}{4!} - \cdots\right) + i\left(\theta - \frac{\theta^3}{3!} + \frac{\theta^5}{5!} - \cdots\right)$$

The first parentheses contain exactly the series for $\cos\theta$, and the second contain the series for $\sin\theta$!
```

### A.2.3 Physical Interpretation: Rotation in the Complex Plane

Euler's formula has a beautiful geometric meaning: $e^{i\theta}$ represents a point on the unit circle at angle $\theta$ from the positive real axis. As $\theta$ increases, $e^{i\theta}$ traces out circular motion in the complex plane.

```{margin}
This is why complex exponentials are perfect for describing oscillatory motion—they naturally encode both the magnitude and phase of oscillations.
```

This insight is crucial for optics because light waves are oscillatory phenomena. The phase $\theta$ in Euler's formula will correspond to the phase of an electromagnetic wave, while the magnitude can represent the amplitude.

### A.2.4 Special Cases and Identities

Several important special cases emerge from Euler's formula:

```{list-table} Important Special Cases
:header-rows: 1
:name: euler-special-cases

* - Angle
  - Complex Exponential
  - Trigonometric Form
  - Significance
* - $\theta = 0$
  - $e^{i \cdot 0} = 1$
  - $\cos(0) + i\sin(0) = 1$
  - Starting point
* - $\theta = \pi/2$
  - $e^{i\pi/2} = i$
  - $\cos(\pi/2) + i\sin(\pi/2) = i$
  - 90° rotation
* - $\theta = \pi$
  - $e^{i\pi} = -1$
  - $\cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi) = -1$

* - $\theta = 2\pi$
  - $e^{i2\pi} = 1$
  - $\cos(2\pi) + i\sin(2\pi) = 1$
  - Full rotation
```

```{important}
**Euler's Identity**: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

This equation connects five fundamental mathematical constants ($e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, and $0$) in a single, elegant relationship. Richard Feynman called it "the most remarkable formula in mathematics."
```

### A.2.5 Properties of Complex Exponentials

Complex exponentials inherit wonderful properties from regular exponentials:

1. **Multiplication Rule**: $e^{i\alpha} \cdot e^{i\beta} = e^{i(\alpha + \beta)}$
2. **Division Rule**: $\frac{e^{i\alpha}}{e^{i\beta}} = e^{i(\alpha - \beta)}$
3. **Power Rule**: $(e^{i\theta})^n = e^{in\theta}$
4. **Conjugate Rule**: $(e^{i\theta})^* = e^{-i\theta}$

These properties make complex exponentials incredibly convenient for calculations involving waves and oscillations.

## A.3 Complex Numbers in Wave Physics

### A.3.1 Why Waves and Complex Numbers Are Perfect Partners

Before diving into optical applications, let's understand why complex numbers are so naturally suited for describing waves. Consider a simple harmonic oscillator—perhaps a mass on a spring, or the electric field in a light wave. The position (or field strength) varies sinusoidally with time:

$$x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$$

While this real function perfectly describes the physical motion, working with it mathematically can be cumbersome. Derivatives of cosines give sines, integrals mix sines and cosines, and keeping track of phase relationships becomes complex (pun intended).

```{admonition} The Complex Solution
Instead of working directly with $A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$, we use the complex representation:

$$\tilde{x}(t) = A e^{i(\omega t + \phi)}$$

The physical quantity is understood to be the real part: $x(t) = \text{Re}[\tilde{x}(t)]$.

Why is this better?
- **Derivatives**: $\frac{d}{dt}[A e^{i(\omega t + \phi)}] = i\omega A e^{i(\omega t + \phi)}$
- **Integration**: $\int A e^{i(\omega t + \phi)} dt = \frac{A}{i\omega} e^{i(\omega t + \phi)}$
- **Superposition**: Adding waves becomes simple complex addition
- **Phase relationships**: Automatically preserved in all calculations
```

### A.3.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Complex Notation

In optics, we deal with electromagnetic waves—oscillating electric and magnetic fields. A plane wave traveling in the positive $z$-direction can be written as:

$$\vec{E}(z,t) = \vec{E}_0 e^{i(kz - \omega t + \phi)}$$

Let's unpack this expression:

```{list-table} Wave Parameters
:header-rows: 1
:name: wave-parameters

* - Symbol
  - Name
  - Physical Meaning
  - Units
* - $\vec{E}_0$
  - Amplitude vector
  - Maximum field strength and polarization direction
  - V/m
* - $k$
  - Wave number
  - $k = 2\pi/\lambda$, spatial frequency
  - rad/m
* - $\omega$
  - Angular frequency
  - $\omega = 2\pi f$, temporal frequency
  - rad/s
* - $\phi$
  - Phase constant
  - Initial phase at $z=t=0$
  - rad
```

The argument of the exponential, $(kz - \omega t + \phi)$, is called the **phase** of the wave. This single expression contains all the information about how the wave varies in space and time.

```{note}
**Why the minus sign?** The combination $(kz - \omega t)$ describes a wave moving in the positive $z$-direction. At a fixed time, increasing $z$ increases the phase. At a fixed position, increasing time decreases the phase—meaning the same phase point has moved to a larger $z$ value.
```

### A.3.3 Physical Fields from Complex Expressions

The actual, measurable electric field is always real. We extract it by taking the real part of our complex expression:

$$\vec{E}_{\text{physical}}(z,t) = \text{Re}[\vec{E}_0 e^{i(kz - \omega t + \phi)}]$$

If $\vec{E}_0 = E_0 \hat{x}$ (linearly polarized in the $x$-direction), then:

$$E_{\text{physical}}(z,t) = E_0 \cos(kz - \omega t + \phi) \hat{x}$$

This is the familiar sinusoidal wave we expect for light.

## A.4 Interference: Where Complex Numbers Shine

### A.4.1 The Superposition Principle

One of the most important principles in optics is **superposition**: when two or more waves overlap, the total field is simply the sum of the individual fields. With complex notation, this becomes beautifully simple.

Consider two waves with the same frequency but different amplitudes and phases:

$$E_1 = E_{01} e^{i(kz - \omega t + \phi_1)}$$
$$E_2 = E_{02} e^{i(kz - \omega t + \phi_2)}$$

The total field is:
$$E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = e^{i(kz - \omega t)}[E_{01}e^{i\phi_1} + E_{02}e^{i\phi_2}]$$

```{admonition} Example A.4: Two-Wave Interference
Suppose we have two waves with equal amplitudes $E_{01} = E_{02} = E_0$ but phases $\phi_1 = 0$ and $\phi_2 = \phi$:

$$E_{\text{total}} = E_0 e^{i(kz - \omega t)}[1 + e^{i\phi}]$$
$$= E_0 e^{i(kz - \omega t)}[1 + \cos\phi + i\sin\phi]$$
$$= E_0 e^{i(kz - \omega t)}[(1 + \cos\phi) + i\sin\phi]$$

The magnitude of the total field is:
$$|E_{\text{total}}| = E_0\sqrt{(1 + \cos\phi)^2 + \sin^2\phi} = E_0\sqrt{2 + 2\cos\phi} = 2E_0\left|\cos\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\right|$$

This gives us the famous interference pattern:
- **Constructive interference** when $\phi = 0, 2\pi, 4\pi, \ldots$: $|E_{\text{total}}| = 2E_0$
- **Destructive interference** when $\phi = \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, \ldots$: $|E_{\text{total}}| = 0$
```

### A.4.2 Intensity and the Complex Conjugate

The intensity of light is proportional to the time-averaged square of the electric field. For a complex field $E(t)$, the intensity is:

$$I \propto \langle|E(t)|^2\rangle = \langle E(t) \cdot E^*(t)\rangle$$

```{margin}
The time averaging $\langle \cdot \rangle$ removes the rapidly oscillating terms at frequency $2\omega$, leaving only the slowly varying envelope.
```

For our two-wave interference example:
$$I \propto |E_1 + E_2|^2 = (E_1 + E_2)(E_1^* + E_2^*)$$
$$= |E_1|^2 + |E_2|^2 + E_1E_2^* + E_1^*E_2$$
$$= |E_1|^2 + |E_2|^2 + 2\text{Re}(E_1E_2^*)$$

The last term is the **interference term**—it's what creates the bright and dark fringes in interference patterns. Without complex numbers, deriving this result would involve tedious trigonometric identities.

## A.5 Complex Refractive Index: Absorption and Dispersion

### A.5.1 Beyond Simple Refraction

When light propagates through most materials, two important effects occur:
1. The wave slows down (refraction)
2. The wave weakens (absorption)

A **complex refractive index** elegantly describes both effects:

$$\tilde{n} = n + ik$$

where:
- $n$ is the familiar refractive index (affects phase velocity)
- $k$ is the **extinction coefficient** (causes absorption)

### A.5.2 Wave Propagation in Absorbing Media

When a wave propagates through a medium with complex refractive index $\tilde{n}$, the wave number becomes complex:

$$\tilde{k} = \frac{\omega \tilde{n}}{c} = \frac{\omega(n + ik)}{c} = \frac{\omega n}{c} + i\frac{\omega k}{c}$$

The wave in the medium becomes:
$$E(z) = E_0 e^{i\tilde{k}z} = E_0 e^{i(\omega n/c)z} e^{-(\omega k/c)z}$$

```{important}
This expression reveals the physical meaning of the complex refractive index:
- The real part $n$ gives oscillatory behavior: $e^{i(\omega n/c)z}$
- The imaginary part $k$ gives exponential decay: $e^{-(\omega k/c)z}$

The intensity decreases as $I(z) = I_0 e^{-2(\omega k/c)z}$, defining the absorption coefficient $\alpha = 2\omega k/c$.
```

```

## A.6 Advanced Applications in Optics

### A.6.1 Fresnel Coefficients and Reflection

When light hits an interface between two media, some reflects and some transmits. The **Fresnel coefficients** describe these processes and are naturally expressed using complex numbers.

For s-polarized light (electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence):

$$r_s = \frac{n_1\cos\theta_1 - n_2\cos\theta_2}{n_1\cos\theta_1 + n_2\cos\theta_2}$$

where angles are related by Snell's law: $n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2$.

```{admonition} Total Internal Reflection
When $n_1 > n_2$ and $\theta_1$ exceeds the critical angle $\theta_c = \arcsin(n_2/n_1)$, something remarkable happens:

$\sin\theta_2 = \frac{n_1}{n_2}\sin\theta_1 > 1$

This makes $\cos\theta_2 = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2\theta_2}$ imaginary! The reflection coefficient becomes complex:

$$r_s = \frac{n_1\cos\theta_1 - in_2\sqrt{\sin^2\theta_1 - (n_2/n_1)^2}}{n_1\cos\theta_1 + in_2\sqrt{\sin^2\theta_1 - (n_2/n_1)^2}}$$

The magnitude $|r_s| = 1$ (perfect reflection), but the phase changes upon reflection. This phase shift is crucial for understanding phenomena like the Goos-Hänchen effect.
```

### A.6.2 Polarization States

Complex numbers provide an elegant description of polarization. A general elliptically polarized wave can be written as:

$$\vec{E} = E_x e^{i\phi_x} \hat{x} + E_y e^{i\phi_y} \hat{y}$$

The polarization state is determined by:
- **Amplitude ratio**: $E_y/E_x$
- **Phase difference**: $\delta = \phi_y - \phi_x$

```{list-table} Polarization States
:header-rows: 1
:name: polarization-states

* - Polarization Type
  - Amplitude Condition
  - Phase Condition
  - Complex Representation
* - Linear (x-direction)
  - $E_y = 0$
  - Any
  - $E_0 \hat{x}$
* - Linear (45°)
  - $E_x = E_y$
  - $\delta = 0$
  - $E_0(\hat{x} + \hat{y})/\sqrt{2}$
* - Right circular
  - $E_x = E_y$
  - $\delta = -\pi/2$
  - $E_0(\hat{x} - i\hat{y})/\sqrt{2}$
* - Left circular
  - $E_x = E_y$
  - $\delta = +\pi/2$
  - $E_0(\hat{x} + i\hat{y})/\sqrt{2}$
```

### A.6.3 Fourier Optics: Spatial Frequencies

Modern optics heavily relies on Fourier analysis, which is built on complex exponentials. The spatial Fourier transform of a function $f(x,y)$ is:

$$F(k_x, k_y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x,y) e^{-i(k_x x + k_y y)} dx dy$$

This mathematical framework enables:
- **Diffraction analysis**: Understanding how apertures affect light
- **Image formation**: How lenses create images
- **Holography**: Recording and reconstructing wavefronts
- **Optical information processing**: Manipulating spatial frequencies

```{note}
In Fourier optics, we think of any optical field as a superposition of plane waves with different spatial frequencies $(k_x, k_y)$. Each plane wave has a complex amplitude $F(k_x, k_y)$ that encodes both its strength and phase. This perspective revolutionizes how we understand optical systems.
```

## A.7 Computational Techniques

### A.7.1 Time Averaging with Complex Fields

A common calculation in optics involves time averaging oscillatory quantities. For a field $E(t) = E_0 e^{-i\omega t}$:

$$\langle E(t) E^*(t) \rangle = \langle E_0 e^{-i\omega t} \cdot E_0^* e^{+i\omega t} \rangle = |E_0|^2 \langle e^0 \rangle = |E_0|^2$$

The rapidly oscillating terms average to zero, leaving only the slowly varying envelope.

### A.7.2 Differentiation in the Frequency Domain

Time and spatial derivatives become algebraic operations:
- $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}[e^{-i\omega t}] = -i\omega e^{-i\omega t}$
- $\frac{\partial}{\partial z}[e^{ikz}] = ik e^{ikz}$

This transforms differential equations (like Maxwell's equations) into algebraic equations, greatly simplifying analysis.

### A.7.3 Phasor Diagrams

Complex numbers can be visualized as rotating vectors (phasors) in the complex plane. This visualization is particularly powerful for:

```{list-table} Phasor Applications

```

## A.8 Why Complex Numbers Work So Well in Optics

### A.8.1 Mathematical Elegance

Complex numbers work beautifully in optics because they match the mathematical structure of wave phenomena:

1. **Linearity**: Both wave equations and complex arithmetic are linear
2. **Superposition**: Adding waves ↔ Adding complex numbers
3. **Harmonic motion**: Natural connection to $e^{i\omega t}$
4. **Phase relationships**: Automatically preserved in calculations

### A.8.2 Physical Insight

Beyond mathematical convenience, complex numbers often reveal physical insights:

```{admonition} Physical Insights from Complex Analysis
- **Causality**: The relationship between real and imaginary parts of the refractive index (Kramers-Kronig relations) ensures that materials respond to light in physically reasonable ways
- **Energy conservation**: Complex analysis helps prove that energy is conserved in optical systems
- **Symmetries**: Many optical phenomena have symmetries that are most naturally expressed using complex numbers
- **Analytic continuation**: Physical principles can be extended into the complex plane, often revealing new phenomena
```

### A.8.3 Computational Power

Modern optics relies heavily on numerical computation. Complex numbers enable:
- **FFT algorithms**: Fast Fourier transforms for diffraction calculations
- **Matrix methods**: Describing optical systems using complex matrices
- **Beam propagation**: Numerical solution of wave equations
- **Nonlinear optics**: Analysis of intensity-dependent phenomena

## A.9 Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### A.9.1 Physical vs. Mathematical Fields

```{warning}
**Pitfall**: Forgetting that the physical electric field is always real.

**Solution**: Always take $\text{Re}[\cdots]$ when interpreting results physically. The complex representation is a mathematical tool—the actual field oscillating in space is real.
```

### A.9.2 Phase Conventions

```{warning}
**Pitfall**: Inconsistent phase conventions leading to wrong interference patterns.

**Solution**: Establish a clear convention early (e.g., $e^{i(kz - \omega t)}$ for waves traveling in the $+z$ direction) and stick to it throughout your analysis.
```

### A.9.3 Complex Conjugation in Intensity Calculations

```{warning}
**Pitfall**: Forgetting to use complex conjugates when calculating intensities.

**Solution**: Remember that intensity $I \propto |E|^2 = E \cdot E^*$, not $E^2$. For real fields these are the same, but for complex fields they're different.
```

## A.10 Summary and Looking Forward

```

## A.11 Worked Examples

### A.11.1 Young's Double-Slit Interference

```{admonition} Problem Setup
Two coherent sources separated by distance $d$ illuminate a screen at distance $L \gg d$. Find the intensity pattern on the screen using complex analysis.
```

**Solution:**

Let's place the two slits at $y = \pm d/2$ and consider a point $P$ on the screen at height $y$. The path difference between rays from the two slits is approximately:

$\Delta = \frac{yd}{L}$

for small angles.

The fields from the two slits at point $P$ are:
$E_1 = E_0 e^{i(kL - \omega t)}$
$E_2 = E_0 e^{i(kL + k\Delta - \omega t)} = E_0 e^{i(kL - \omega t)} e^{ikyd/L}$

The total field is:
$E_{\text{total}} = E_0 e^{i(kL - \omega t)}[1 + e^{ikyd/L}]$

To find the intensity, we calculate $|E_{\text{total}}|^2$:
$|E_{\text{total}}|^2 = |E_0|^2 |1 + e^{ikyd/L}|^2$

Using $|1 + e^{i\phi}|^2 = (1 + e^{i\phi})(1 + e^{-i\phi}) = 2 + 2\cos\phi$:

$I(y) = 2|E_0|^2[1 + \cos(kyd/L)] = 4|E_0|^2 \cos^2\left(\frac{kyd}{2L}\right)$

```{note}
This derivation using complex numbers is much more straightforward than the traditional approach using trigonometric identities. The key insight is that $|1 + e^{i\phi}|^2$ automatically gives us the interference pattern.
```

Light with intensity $I_0$ passes through a glass slab of thickness $t$ with complex refractive index $\tilde{n} = 1.5 + 0.01i$. Find the transmitted intensity, accounting for both reflection losses and absorption.
```

**Solution:**

This problem involves multiple physical processes:
1. Reflection at the first interface
2. Absorption within the slab
3. Reflection at the second interface

**Step 1: First interface (air to glass)**
The Fresnel reflection coefficient for normal incidence is:
$r_{12} = \frac{1 - \tilde{n}}{1 + \tilde{n}} = \frac{1 - (1.5 + 0.01i)}{1 + (1.5 + 0.01i)} = \frac{-0.5 - 0.01i}{2.5 + 0.01i}$

To compute this, multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
$r_{12} = \frac{(-0.5 - 0.01i)(2.5 - 0.01i)}{(2.5 + 0.01i)(2.5 - 0.01i)} = \frac{-1.25 + 0.02i}{6.25 + 0.0001} \approx -0.1998 + 0.0032i$

The reflectance is $R_1 = |r_{12}|^2 \approx 0.0399$.

The transmission coefficient is $t_{12} = 1 + r_{12} \approx 0.8002 + 0.0032i$.

**Step 2: Propagation through the slab**
The wave number in the material is:
$k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_0}\tilde{n} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda_0}(1.5 + 0.01i)$

After propagating distance $t$, the field is multiplied by:
$e^{ik t} = e^{i(2\pi/\lambda_0)(1.5 + 0.01i)t} = e^{i(2\pi/\lambda_0)(1.5t)} e^{-(2\pi/\lambda_0)(0.01t)}$

The absorption factor is $e^{-(2\pi/\lambda_0)(0.01t)}$.

**Step 3: Second interface (glass to air)**
By reciprocity, $r_{21} = -r_{12}$ and the reflectance is the same: $R_2 = 0.0399$.

**Step 4: Total transmission**
The transmitted intensity fraction is:
$T = (1-R_1)(1-R_2)e^{-2(2\pi/\lambda_0)(0.01t)}$
$= (1-0.0399)^2 e^{-(4\pi \cdot 0.01t)/\lambda_0}$
$= 0.922 \cdot e^{-0.126t/\lambda_0}$

```{important}
For typical glass at $\lambda_0 = 500$ nm and $t = 1$ mm:
$T = 0.922 \cdot e^{-0.126 \times 10^{-3}/(500 \times 10^{-9})} = 0.922 \cdot e^{-252} \approx 0$

The slab is essentially opaque! This shows why the imaginary part of the refractive index must be very small for transparent materials.
```

### A.11.3 Circular Polarization Analysis

```{admonition} Problem Setup
Light passes through a linear polarizer oriented at 45° to the x-axis, then through a quarter-wave plate with fast axis along x. Determine the final polarization state.
```

**Solution:**

**Initial state**: Unpolarized light can be represented as an incoherent mixture of all polarization states.

**After linear polarizer at 45°**: The transmitted field is linearly polarized:
$\vec{E}_1 = E_0 \frac{(\hat{x} + \hat{y})}{\sqrt{2}}$

**Quarter-wave plate action**: A quarter-wave plate introduces a phase difference of $\pi/2$ between its fast and slow axes. With the fast axis along x, it multiplies the y-component by $e^{i\pi/2} = i$:

$\vec{E}_2 = E_0 \frac{(\hat{x} + i\hat{y})}{\sqrt{2}}$

**Analysis**: This is left-handed circular polarization! We can verify this by checking the time dependence:

$\vec{E}(t) = \text{Re}\left[E_0 \frac{(\hat{x} + i\hat{y})}{\sqrt{2}} e^{-i\omega t}\right]$
$= E_0 \frac{(\cos\omega t \hat{x} + \cos(\omega t - \pi/2)\hat{y})}{\sqrt{2}}$
$= E_0 \frac{(\cos\omega t \hat{x} + \sin\omega t \hat{y})}{\sqrt{2}}$

At $t = 0$: $\vec{E} = (E_0/\sqrt{2})\hat{x}$
At $t = \pi/(2\omega)$: $\vec{E} = (E_0/\sqrt{2})\hat{y}$
At $t = \pi/\omega$: $\vec{E} = -(E_0/\sqrt{2})\hat{x}$
At $t = 3\pi/(2\omega)$: $\vec{E} = -(E_0/\sqrt{2})\hat{y}$

The electric field vector rotates counterclockwise when viewed against the direction of propagation—this is left-handed circular polarization.

```{note}
Complex notation makes polarization analysis much simpler than using Jones matrices or Stokes parameters. The phase relationships are automatically maintained throughout the calculation.

## A.12 Practice Problems

### A.12.1 Basic Complex Arithmetic

```{admonition} Problem A.1
:class: exercise

Calculate the following and express in the form $a + bi$:
a) $(3 + 2i)(1 - 4i)$
b) $\frac{2 + 3i}{1 - i}$
c) $(1 + i)^4$
d) $\sqrt{3 + 4i}$
```

```{dropdown} Solution to Problem A.1
a) $(3 + 2i)(1 - 4i) = 3 - 12i + 2i - 8i^2 = 3 - 10i + 8 = 11 - 10i$

b) $\frac{2 + 3i}{1 - i} = \frac{(2 + 3i)(1 + i)}{(1 - i)(1 + i)} = \frac{2 + 2i + 3i - 3}{1 + 1} = \frac{-1 + 5i}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{5}{2}i$

c) $(1 + i)^4 = [(1 + i)^2]^2 = [1 + 2i - 1]^2 = (2i)^2 = -4$

d) Let $\sqrt{3 + 4i} = a + bi$. Then $(a + bi)^2 = 3 + 4i$.
   Expanding: $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = 3 + 4i$
   So: $a^2 - b^2 = 3$ and $2ab = 4$, giving $b = 2/a$
   Substituting: $a^2 - 4/a^2 = 3$, so $a^4 - 3a^2 - 4 = 0$
   Let $u = a^2$: $u^2 - 3u - 4 = 0$, giving $u = 4$ or $u = -1$
   Since $u = a^2 \geq 0$, we have $a^2 = 4$, so $a = \pm 2$
   If $a = 2$, then $b = 1$; if $a = -2$, then $b = -1$
   Therefore: $\sqrt{3 + 4i} = \pm(2 + i)$
```

### A.12.2 Wave Interference

```{admonition} Problem A.2
:class: exercise

Two coherent plane waves with equal amplitudes $E_0$ interfere. Wave 1 has phase 0, and Wave 2 has phase $\phi$.
a) Find the total amplitude as a function of $\phi$
b) For what values of $\phi$ is the intensity maximum?
c) For what values of $\phi$ is the intensity minimum?
d) Plot the intensity as a function of $\phi$ from 0 to $4\pi$
```

```{dropdown} Solution to Problem A.2
a) $E_{\text{total}} = E_0(1 + e^{i\phi}) = E_0(1 + \cos\phi + i\sin\phi)$

   $|E_{\text{total}}|^2 = E_0^2[(1 + \cos\phi)^2 + \sin^2\phi] = E_0^2[1 + 2\cos\phi + \cos^2\phi + \sin^2\phi]$

   $= E_0^2[2 + 2\cos\phi] = 2E_0^2(1 + \cos\phi) = 4E_0^2\cos^2(\phi/2)$

b) Maximum when $\cos(\phi/2) = \pm 1$, i.e., $\phi = 0, 2\pi, 4\pi, \ldots$

c) Minimum when $\cos(\phi/2) = 0$, i.e., $\phi = \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, \ldots$

d) $I(\phi) = I_0 \cos^2(\phi/2)$ where $I_0 = 4E_0^2$ is the maximum intensity.
```

### A.12.3 Complex Refractive Index

```{admonition} Problem A.3
:class: exercise

A material has refractive index $\tilde{n} = 1.6 + 0.05i$ at wavelength $\lambda_0 = 600$ nm.
a) What is the phase velocity in this material?
b) What is the absorption coefficient?
c) How far does light travel before its intensity drops to 1/e of its initial value?
d) What fraction of the intensity remains after traveling 10 μm?
```

```{dropdown} Solution to Problem A.3
a) Phase velocity: $v = c/n = 3 \times 10^8 / 1.6 = 1.875 \times 10^8$ m/s

b) Absorption coefficient: $\alpha = 2\omega k/c = 4\pi k/\lambda_0 = 4\pi \times 0.05/(600 \times 10^{-9}) = 1.047 \times 10^6$ m$^{-1}$

c) Intensity drops to 1/e when $e^{-\alpha z} = 1/e$, so $\alpha z = 1$
   $z = 1/\alpha = 1/(1.047 \times 10^6) = 9.55 \times 10^{-7}$ m = 0.955 μm

d) After 10 μm: $I/I_0 = e^{-\alpha \times 10^{-5}} = e^{-10.47} = 2.8 \times 10^{-5}$
   Only 0.0028% of the original intensity remains!
```

### A.12.4 Polarization

```{admonition} Problem A.4
:class: exercise

Light is initially polarized at 30° to the x-axis: $\vec{E}_0 = E_0(\cos 30° \hat{x} + \sin 30° \hat{y})$.
a) Express this in complex notation
b) This light passes through a half-wave plate with fast axis at 45°. Find the transmitted polarization state
c) What angle does the final polarization make with the x-axis?
```

```{dropdown} Solution to Problem A.4
a) $\vec{E}_0 = E_0(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\hat{x} + \frac{1}{2}\hat{y})$

b) A half-wave plate at 45° can be represented by the Jones matrix:
   $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$

   This swaps the x and y components:
   $\vec{E}_f = E_0(\frac{1}{2}\hat{x} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\hat{y})$

c) The final angle is: $\theta_f = \arctan(\frac{\sqrt{3}/2}{1/2}) = \arctan(\sqrt{3}) = 60°$

Note: The half-wave plate rotated the polarization by $2 \times (45° - 30°) = 30°$, from 30° to 60°.

## A.14 Final Thoughts: The Beauty of Mathematical Physics

As you've seen throughout this appendix, complex numbers aren't just computational tools—they're windows into the fundamental nature of wave phenomena. The fact that $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ connects the most important constants in mathematics is no accident. It reflects deep symmetries in the mathematical structures that govern our physical world.

In optics, these mathematical structures manifest as:
- **Wave-particle duality**: The complex wavefunction that bridges classical waves and quantum particles
- **Symmetry principles**: The invariances that lead to conservation laws
- **Analytical properties**: The mathematical constraints that ensure physical causality

As you continue your journey through optics, remember that the mathematics isn't separate from the physics—it *is* the physics, expressed in its most elegant and universal form. Complex numbers are your passport to this deeper understanding.

```{note}
**A Personal Note**: Many students initially find complex numbers abstract and intimidating. This is completely normal! The key is to work with them regularly, visualize them geometrically, and always connect the mathematical operations back to physical phenomena. Over time, you'll develop an intuition that makes complex analysis feel as natural as ordinary arithmetic. When that happens, you'll have gained one of the most powerful tools in all of physics.
