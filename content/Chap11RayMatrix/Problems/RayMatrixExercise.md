**Problem 11.1** \* Principal planes for a thick lens.


In this problem the transfer matrix for a thick lens is derived. By finding the positions of the principal planes, you will derive that the transfer matrix has the same form as for a thin lens when object, image and focal distances are measured with respect to principle planes.


The transfer matrices which you should use are those for refraction through a spherical interface between two media with refractive indices $n$, $n'$
to the left and right of the interface, respectively, and with radius of curvature $R$:

$$
{\cal S} = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}1 & -k \\0 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\nonumber
$$

where
$k=(n'-n)/R$, and secondly the matrix ${\cal M}_d$ for propagation through a medium with refractive index $n$ over a distance $d$.

Consider a thick lens made of a glass of refractive index $n$ with thickness $d$. For paraxial rays, the thickness can be identified with the distance between the vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$ of the surfaces of the lens.

**(a)** Derive that the transfer matrix between the surfaces through the two vertices of the thick lens is given by:

```{math}
:label: eq:ray:thickLensVertexMatrix
\begin{align*}
{\cal L}_{V_2V_1} =
\left( \begin{array}{cc}1 - k_2 \frac{d}{n} & -k_1 -k_2 + k_1 k_2 \frac{d}{n} \\\frac{d}{n} & 1-k_1 \frac{d}{n}
\end{array}\right)
\end{align*}
```
where $k_1= (n-1)/R_1$ and $k_2= (1-n)/R_2$


**(b)** Show that for $d=0$ the transfer matrix is identical to that for a thin lens given by
  {eq}`eq:ray:thin-lens-matrix`.


In Section 3.5.7 of the Lecture Notes the primary and secondary principle planes were defined. Let the distance between the primary principle plane ${\cal H}_1$ and vertex $V_1$ be $T_1$, and let the distance of the second principle plane ${\cal H}_2$ to vertex $V_2$ be $T_2$ as shown in {numref}`fig:ray:thicklens2`). $T_1>0$ and $T_2>0$ if the first principle plane is to the left of $V_1$ and the second principle plane is to the right of $V_2$, respectively, while $T_1$ and $T_2$ are negative otherwise.

The transformation of a ray from the primary principle plane ${\cal H}_1$ to the secondary principle plane ${\cal H}_2$ is:

```{math}
:label: eq:ray:principalPlaneTransform
\left( \begin{array}{c}\alpha_1 \\y_1
\end{array}\right) = {\cal L}_{{\cal H}_1{\cal H}_2} \left( \begin{array}{c}\alpha_2 \\y_2
\end{array}\right),
```

where

```{math}
\begin{align*}
{\cal L}_{{\cal H}_2{\cal H}_1} = {\cal M}_{ T_2} {\cal L}_{V_2 V_1} {\cal M}_{T_1},
\end{align*}
```

**(c)** By using the following abbreviation for the matrix {eq}`eq:ray:thickLensVertexMatrix`:

```{math}
:label: eq:ray:matrixAbbreviation
\begin{align*}
\left( \begin{array}{cc}1 - k_2 \frac{d}{n} & -k_1 -k_2 + k_1 k_2 \frac{d}{n} \\\frac{d}{n} & 1-k_1 \frac{d}{n}
\end{array}\right) = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}a_{11} & a_{12} \\a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{array}\right),
\end{align*}
```
derive that:

```{math}
:label: eq:ray:principalPlaneMatrixExpanded
\begin{align*}
{\cal L}_{{\cal H}_2{\cal H}_1} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}a_{11} + T_1 a_{12} & \; a_{12} \\T_2 (a_{11} +T_1 a_{12}) + a_{21} + T_1 a_{22} & \; a_{22} + T_2 a_{12}
\end{array}\right)
\end{align*}
```

**(d)** The principle planes are conjugate (i.e. they are each other images) with unit magnification. Derive from this fact that the locations of the principle planes are given by:


```{math}
\begin{align*}
T_2&=\frac{1-a_{22}}{a_{12} }\\
T_1&= \frac{1-a_{11}}{a_{12}}
\end{align*}
```


With the solutions for $T_1$ and $T_2$ the system matrix between the principal planes becomes:

```{math}
:label: eq:ray:principalPlaneMatrix
{\cal L}_{{\cal H}_2{\cal H}_1} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}1 & a_{12} \\0 & 1
\end{array}\right)
```

which has the same shape as the transfer matrix for a thin lens.

**(e)** Show that the back focal point is at distance $1/a_{12}$ from the secondary principle plane and that the front focal plane is at distance $1/a_{12}$ from the primary principle plane.
