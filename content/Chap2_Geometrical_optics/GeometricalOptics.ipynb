    "## Introduction\n",
    "Geometrical optics is an old subject but it is still essential to understand and design optical instruments such as camera's, microscopes, telescopes etc. Geometrical optics started long before light was described as a wave as is done in wave optics, and long before it was discovered that light is an electromagnetic wave and that optics is part of electromagnetism.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we go back in history and treat geometrical optics. That may seem strange now that we have a much more accurate and better theory at our disposal. However, the predictions of geometrical optics are under quite common circumstances very useful and also very accurate. In fact, for many optical systems and practical instruments there is no alternative for geometrical optics because more accurate theories are much too complicated to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a material is illuminated, its molecules start to radiate spherical waves (more precisely, they radiate like tiny electric dipoles) and the total wave scattered by the material is the sum of all these spherical waves. A time-harmonic wave has at every point in space and at every instant of time a well defined phase.\n",
    "A **wave front** is a set of space-time points where the phase has the same value. At any fixed time, the wave front is called a surface of constant phase. This surface moves with the phase velocity in the direction of its local normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For plane waves we have shown in the previous chapter that the surfaces of constant phase are planes and that the normal to these surfaces is in the direction of the wave vector which coincides with the direction of the phase velocity as well as with the direction of the flow of energy (the direction of the Poynting vector). For general waves, the local direction of energy flow is given by the direction of the Poynting vector. Provided that the radius of curvature of the surfaces is much larger than the wavelength, the normal to the surfaces of constant phase may still be considered to be in the direction of the local flow of energy. Such waves behave locally as plane waves and their effect can be accurately described by the methods of geometrical optics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrical optics is based on the intuitive idea that light consists of a bundle of rays. But what is a ray?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "A ray is an oriented curve which is everywhere perpendicular to the surfaces of constant phase and points in the direction of the flow of energy.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a point source at some distance before an opaque screen with an aperture. According to the ray picture, the light distribution on a second screen further away from the source and parallel to the first screen is simply an enlarged copy of the aperture (see {numref}`Fig_2_01_GeomDiffr`). The copy is enlarged due to the fanning out of the rays. However, this description is only accurate when the wavelength of the light is very small compared to the diameter of the aperture. If the aperture is only ten times the wavelength, the pattern is much broader due to the bending of the rays around the edge of the aperture. This phenomenon is called **diffraction**. Diffraction can not be explained by geometrical optics and will be studied in [](chapter.diffraction).\n",

    "Light distribution on a screen due to a rectangular aperture. Left: for a large aperture, we get an enlarged copy of the aperture. Right: for an aperture that is of the order of the wavelength there is strong bending (diffraction) of the light. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrical optics is accurate when the sizes of the objects in the system are large compared to the wavelength. It is possible to derive geometrical optics from Maxwell's equations by formally expanding the electromagnetic field in a power series in the wavelength and retaining only the first term of this expansion <sup>[^1]</sup>. However, this derivation is not rigorous because the power series generally does not converge (it is a so-called asymptotic series).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is possible to incorporate polarisation into geometrical optics <sup>[^2]</sup>, this is not standard theory and we will not consider polarisation effects in this chapter\n",

    "## Principle of Fermat\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point of the treatment of geometrical optics is the \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**Principle of Fermat (1657)**. The path followed by a light ray between two points is the one that takes the least amount of time.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of light in a material with refractive index $n$, is $c/n$, where $c=3\\times 10^8$ m/s is the speed of light in vacuum. At the time of Fermat, the conviction was that the speed of light must be finite, but nobody could suspect how incredibly large it actually is. In 1676 the Danish astronomer Ole R&ouml;mer computed the speed from inspecting the eclipses of a moon of Jupiter and arrived at an estimate that was only 30\\% too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{r}(s)$, be a ray with $s$ the length parameter. The ray links two points $S$ and $P$.\n",
    "Suppose that the refractive index varies with position: $n(\\mathbf{r})$. Over the infinitesimal distance from $s$ to\n",
    "$s+\\mathrm{d}s$, the speed of the light is\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{c}{n(\\mathbf{r}(s))}.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hence the time it takes for light to go from $\\mathbf{r}(s)$ to $\\mathbf{r}(s+\\mathrm{d}s)$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq.defdt\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{n(\\mathbf{r}(s))}{c} \\mathrm{d}s,\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "```\n",
    "and the total total time to go from $S$ to $P$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq.ttot\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "t_{S \\rightarrow P} = \\int_0^{s_P} \\frac{n(\\mathbf{r}(s))}{c} \\mathrm{d}s,\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "```\n",
    "where $s_P$ is the distance along the ray from S to P.\n",
    "The **optical path length** [m] of the ray between S and P is defined by:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So the OPL is the distance weighted by the refractive index. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark.**\n",
    "Actually, Fermat's principle as formulated above is not complete. There are circumstances that a ray can take two paths between two points that have different travel times. Each of these paths then corresponds to a minimum travel time compared to nearby paths, so the travel time is in general a *local minimum*. An example is the reflection by a mirror discussed in the following section.\n",

    "- **Homogeneous matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "In homogenous matter, the refractive index is constant and therefore paths of shortest OPL are straight lines. Hence in homogeneous matter rays are straight lines.\n",
    "- **Inhomogeneous matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the refractive index is a function of position such as air with a temperature gradient, the rays bend towards regions of higher refractive index. In the case of {numref}`Fig_2_02_Theory_of_mirage` for example, the ray from the top of the tree to the eye of the observer passes on a warm day close to the ground because there the temperature is higher and hence the refractive index is smaller. Although the curved path is longer than the straight path, the total travel time of the light is less because near the ground the light speed is higher (since the refractive index is smaller). The observer gets the impression that the tree is upside down under the ground.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the mirror shown in {numref}`Fig_2_03_Descartes_Reflection`. Since the medium above th mirror is homogeneous, a ray from point $P$ can end up in $Q$ in two ways: by going along a straight line directly form $P$ to $Q$ or alternatively by straight lines via the mirror. Both possibilities have different path lengths and hence different travel times and hence both are local minima mentioned at the end of the previous section. We consider here the path by means of reflection by the mirror.\n",

Let $(x_P, y_P)$ and $(x_Q,y_Q)$ be the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$, respectively. If $(x,0)$ is the point where a ray from $P$ to $Q$ hits the mirror, the travel time of that ray is\n",

    "We will first show that within Gaussian optics a single spherical surface between two media with refractive indices $n_1< n_2$ images all points perfectly ({numref}`Fig_2_10_Spherical_interface`). The sphere has radius $R$ and centre $C$ which is inside medium 2. We consider a point object $S$ to the left of the surface. We draw a ray from $S$ perpendicular to the surface. The point of intersection is $V$. Since for this ray the angle of incidence with the local normal on the surface vanishes, the ray continues into the second medium without refraction and passes through the centre $C$ of the sphere. Next we draw a ray that hits the spherical surface in some point $A$ and draw the refracted ray in medium 2 using Snell's law in the paraxial form {eq}`eq.Snell3`. Note that the angles of incidence and transmission must be measured with respect to the local normal at $A$, i.e. with respect to $CA$. We assume that this ray intersects the first ray in point $P$.

Because there is no actual concentration of light intensity at $P$, it is called a **virtual image**, in contrast with the **real images** that occur to the right of the surface and where there is an actual concentration of light energy. We have in this case $f_o>0$ and $f_<0$, which means that the object and image focal points are to the right and left, respectively, of the surface.\n",

    "Note that also when the power is positive, a virtual image can occur, namely when the object $S$ is in between the object focal point $F_o$ and the surface. Then the bundle of rays from S is so strongly diverging that the surface can not convert it into a convergent bundle and hence again the rays in image space seem to come from a point $P$ to the left of the surface.

The coordinate of a virtual object point is positive: $s_o>0$.\n",
    "One may wonder why we look at this case. The reason is that if we have several spherical surfaces behind each other, we can compute the image of an object point by first determining the intermediate image by the most left surface and then use this intermediate image as object for the next surface and so on. In such a case it can easily happen that an intermediate image is to the right of the next surface and hence is a virtual object for that surface. In the case of {numref}`Fig_2_13_Convex_Virtual_Object` at the left, the power is positive, hence the convergent bundle of incident rays is made even more convergent which leads to a real image point. Indeed when $s_o>0$ and ${\\cal P}>0$ then {eq}`eq.one_surface` implies that always $s_i>0$. At the right of {numref}`Fig_2_13_Convex_Virtual_Object` the power is negative but is not sufficiently strong to turn the convergent incident bundle into a divergent bundle. So the image is still real. However, the image will be virtual when the virtual object $S$ is to the right of $F_o$ (which in this case is to the right of the surface) since then the bundle of rays converges so weakly that the surface turns is into a divergent bundle.\n",

In constructing the entrance pupil, rays are used which propagate from the right to the left. The image can be real or virtual. If there are no lenses between object and aperture stop, the aperture stop itself is the entrance pupil. Similarly, the **exit pupil** is the image of the aperture stop by all elements to the right of it. This image can be real or virtual. The entrance pupil determines for a given object the cone of rays in object space that contribute to the image, while the cone of rays leaving the exit pupil are those taking part in the image formation pupil (see {numref}`Fig_2_25_Aperture_Stop`).\n",

    "A larger magnification means a lower energy density, hence a longer exposure time, i.e. **the speed of the lens is reduced**. Camera lenses are usually specified by two numbers: the focal length $f$, measured with respect to the exit pupil and the diameter $D$ of the exit pupil.

    "## Beyond Gaussian Geometrical Optics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aberrations\n",
    "For designing advanced optical systems Gaussian geometrical optics is not sufficient.\n",
    "Instead non-paraxial rays, and among them also non-meridional rays, must be traced using software based on Snell's Law with the sine of the angles of incidence and refraction. Often many thousands of rays are traced to evaluate the quality of an image.\n",
    "It is then found that in general the non-paraxial rays do not intersect at the ideal Gaussian image point. Instead of a single spot, a spot diagram is found which is more or less confined. The deviation from an ideal point image is quantified in terms of **aberrations**. One distinguishes between monochromatic and chromatic aberrations. The latter are caused by the fact that the refractive index depends on wavelength.\n",
    "Recall that in paraxial geometrical optics Snell's Law {eq}`eq.refrac3` is replaced by: $n_i \\theta_i = n_t \\theta_t$, i.e. $\\sin \\theta_i$ and $\\sin \\theta_t$ are replaced by the linear terms. If instead one retains the first two terms of the Taylor series of the sine, the errors in the image can be quantified by five monochromatic aberrations, the so-called **primary** or **Seidel aberrations**. The best known is **spherical aberration**, which is caused by the fact that for a convergent spherical lens, the rays that makes a large angle with the optical axis are focused closer to the lens than the paraxial rays (see {numref}`Fig_2_26_Aberration_Lens`).\n",

    "**Distortion** is one of the five primary aberrations. It causes deformation of images due to the fact that the magnification depends on the distance of the object point to the optical axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-quality imaging the aberrations have to be reduced by adding more lenses and optimising the curvatures of the surfaces, the thicknesses of the lenses and the distances between them. For high quality systems, a lens with an aspherical surface is sometimes used. Systems with very small aberrations are extremely expensive, in particular if the field of view is large, as is the case in lithographic imaging systems used in the manufacturing of integrated circuits as shown in the lithographic system in {numref}`Fig_2_27_ASML_EUV`.\n",
