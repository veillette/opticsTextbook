# Problems

1. Make a mindmap of the material covered in this chapter.	For more information about mindmaps, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)
2. Describe the (possible) relevance of fiber optics in your line of work.
3. Explain why for optical fiber communication lines the wavelength of choice are $1310$ and $1550\text{nm}$.
4. Show that	the phase factor $(m-1)\pi$ in {eq}`eqEdown` indeed leads to a vanishing $E$-field at the mirrors. Is this the only possible solution?
5. A plastic fiber has a core refractive index of $n_1=1.49$ and a cladding refractive index of $n_2=1.38$. Its core diameter is $1.00\text{mm}$ and light with a wavelength of $633\text{nm}$ is coupled into the fiber from air ($n_{\text{e}}=1.00$). Calculate
	- the internal critical angle $\theta_{\text{i,c}}$
	- the (external) critical angle $\bar{\theta}_{\text{e,c}}$
	- the $\Delta$-parameter (Can you use the approximation?)
	- the numerical aperture
	- the $V$-number (Is this a singlemode or multimode fiber?)
	- the cut-off wavelength

6. Describe, in your own words, the effect of dispersion on a short pulse. What is the maximum length of fiber of a loss-less datalink, given that the dispersion parameter of the fiber $D=20\text{ps/km}\cdot \text{nm}$ and the laser used to communicate has a spectral width of $1.0\text{nm}$? The laser can send light pulses at a rate of $10\text{GHz}$.
7. What is the maximum length of fiber of a dispersion-less datalink, given that the loss of the fiber $\alpha_{\text{dB}}=0.30\text{dB/km}$ and a light pulse can no longer be discriminated from the background noise if $99\%$ of the light is lost?
8. Estimate the loss (in dB) due to the following situations in which two single mode fibers are coupled incorrectly:
	- a fiber with a core diameter of $7.0\mu\text{ m}$ is coupled to a fiber with core diameter $6.0\mu\text{m}$ (see {numref}`figFiberCouplingLoss`).
	- an $500\mu\text{m}$-air gap exists in between two fibers (see {numref}`figFiberCouplingLoss`). Both have a numerical aperture equal to $0.12$ and a core diameter of $6.0\mu\text{m}$.

	To make your estimation, neglect reflection due to refractive index mismatch and assume the incoming light has a Gaussian beam profile with intensity
	```{math}
	\begin{align*}
	I(r,z)=I_0\left(\dfrac{d/4}{d/4+\mathrm{NA}\cdot z}\right)^2\exp\left(\dfrac{-2r^2}{(d/4+\mathrm{NA}\cdot z)^2}\right).
	\end{align*}
	```

	Here, $r$ is the radial coordinate in the $(x,y)$-plane (see {numref}`figFiberTIR`). Integrate over the fiber core into which the light is coupled and divide by $I_0$.
	
	Note that these calculations are simplified, but they give a rough estimate of coupling losses.
