# Problems

**Problem 9.1** Phase Contrast Microscopy.

**(a)** A phase contrast microscope is used to observe a transparent biological cell that introduces a phase shift of $\varphi = 0.2$ radians. Assuming small phase approximation, calculate the intensity variation observed in the image compared to the background.

**(b)** Explain why a standard bright-field microscope cannot image a pure phase object. What modification does the phase contrast microscope introduce to solve this problem?

**Problem 9.2** Confocal Microscopy.

**(a)** A confocal microscope uses a pinhole of diameter 50 μm placed in a conjugate image plane. If the objective has a magnification of 60× and a numerical aperture of 1.4, estimate the effective resolution improvement compared to conventional microscopy.

**(b)** Describe how the pinhole in a confocal microscope improves both lateral and axial resolution. What happens to the signal intensity as the pinhole size decreases?

**Problem 9.3** Fluorescence Microscopy.

**(a)** A fluorescent molecule (GFP) has an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 509 nm. Calculate the Stokes shift in both wavelength and energy.

**(b)** Explain the role of the dichroic mirror in a fluorescence microscope. Why is it essential for separating excitation and emission light?

**Problem 9.4** Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscopy (SNOM).

**(a)** A SNOM probe has an aperture of 50 nm. Estimate the theoretical resolution achievable with this probe when imaging a sample at visible wavelengths (~500 nm). Compare this to the diffraction limit of a conventional microscope with NA = 1.4.

**(b)** Explain the difference between collection mode and excitation mode SNOM. What are the advantages and limitations of each configuration?

**Problem 9.5** Resolution Limits.

**(a)** An optical microscope has a numerical aperture of 1.3 (oil immersion) and operates at λ = 550 nm. Calculate the Rayleigh resolution limit.

**(b)** A confocal microscope is claimed to have 1.4× better lateral resolution than a conventional microscope. Justify this claim using the point spread function properties of confocal imaging.
