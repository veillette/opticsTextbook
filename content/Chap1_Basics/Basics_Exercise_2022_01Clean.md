In a homogeneous medium with permittivity $\epsilon$ and conductivity $\sigma$ and without external sources ($\mathbf{\mathcal{J}}_{ext}=\mathbf{0}$, $\varrho_{ext}=0$), derive from {eq}`eq.chargec` and {eq}`eq.gauss2` that for $t.0$

$$
\varrho_c(t) = -\varrho_c(0) e^{-t/\tau},

$$
where $\varrho_c(0)$ is the charge at time $t=0$ and $\tau=\sigma/\epsilon$ is the relaxation time. Even for a moderate conductor such as sea water, $\tau$ is only $2\times 10^{-10} s$.
This shows that the charge density corresponding to conduction currents is zero.

$$
\mathbf{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{\mathcal{E}} -\epsilon \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{\mathcal{E}}}{\partial t^2} - \mu_0 \sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{\mathcal{E}}}{\partial t}=\mathbf{0}.

The reflected field can be considered to be radiated in vacuum by dipoles in $z>0$ with 	 density given by {eq}`eq.defP`:


$$
\mathbf{\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{r}) = (\epsilon-\epsilon_0)\mathbf{\mathcal{E}}^t(\mathbf{r}),

$$
where $\mathbf{\mathcal{E}}^t(\mathbf{r})$ is the transmitted electric field in point $\mathbf{r}$ with $z>0$.

Consider two electric plane waves with wave vectors $\mathbf{k}_1=k_x\hat{\mathbf{x}}+k_z \hat{\mathbf{z}}$ and $\mathbf{k}_2=k_x\hat{\mathbf{x}}-k_z \hat{\mathbf{z}}$, where $k_z=\sqrt{k_0^2\epsilon-k_x^2}$, where $k_0$ is the wave number in vacuum and $\epsilon$ is the permittivity which is assumed to be real. Let both plane waves be polarised parallel to the $y$-direction and let them have real amplitudes $A_1$ and $A_2$ and suppose that they are in phase for $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{0}$ at $t=0$.

This result proves that the net energy flow in the $z$-direction for the case of an incident plane wave that is partially reflected at an interface is the difference between the incident and the reflected intensities.

$\mathbf{k}^i=k_x\hat{\mathbf{x}}+k_z^i\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ and let $k_x>k_0n_i$, so that the angle of incidence is above the critical angle.

Hint: integrate over a sphere $r=\text{constant}$ using spherical coordinates $\mathbf{r}=r\sin \theta \cos\varphi \hat{\mathbf{x}}+ r\sin\theta \sin \varphi \hat{\mathbf{y}}+r \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{z}}$.
