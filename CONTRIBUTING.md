## Project Expectations

- **Read the docs first.** Skim the resources below before changing files:
  - `README.md` – project overview and quick commands
  - `MAINTENANCE.md` – detailed workflows and troubleshooting
  - `MYST_CONVENTIONS.md` – required MyST syntax and accessibility rules
  - `CLAUDE.md` – guidance for AI assistants contributing to this repo
- **Match existing conventions.** Follow directory layout, naming schemes, and MyST directives already in use.
- **Validate everything.** The automated tooling expects clean linting, reference integrity, and a successful build before a PR is reviewed.

---

## Ways to Contribute

- **Content improvements:** Clarify explanations, fix typos, add examples, or expand problem sets in `content/`.
- **Figures & images:** Update diagrams, improve accessibility, or replace outdated graphics in `content/ChapXX.../Images/`.
- **Tooling & scripts:** Enhance utilities inside `scripts/` (Python or Node) that automate validation, builds, or image processing.
- **Documentation:** Improve guides such as `README.md`, `MAINTENANCE.md`, or this file.
- **Tests & validation:** Strengthen unit tests (`scripts/tests/`) or add new checks for references and figures.

If you’re unsure where to start, look for issues labeled **good first issue**, **documentation**, or **help wanted**.

## Prerequisites and Environment Setup

| Requirement | Recommended Version | Notes |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ----- |
| Node.js | 18+ LTS | Needed for MyST tooling, linting, build, and PWA scripts |
| npm | 9+ | Installed with Node |
| Python | 3.10+ | Required for validation, figure tooling, and tests |
| Git | Latest stable | Standard distributed workflow |
| LaTeX toolchain | texlive-xetex, latexmk | Required for PDF generation (`npm run build`) |

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/opticsTextbook.git
cd opticsTextbook

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # optional but recommended
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Helpful Scripts

- `npm run start` – local dev server with live reload at http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` – full build (image optimization → exports → HTML → PWA)
- `npm run lint:fix` – auto-fix common MyST and formatting issues
- `npm run validate-enhanced` – validate references, citations, labels
- `pytest scripts/tests/ -v` – run Python unit tests

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Discuss or self-assign an issue.** Comment on an open issue or open a new one describing the problem you plan to solve.
2. **Create a feature branch.**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
   ```
3. **Make focused changes.** Keep PRs scoped to a single topic so reviews stay fast.
4. **Run required checks locally.**
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   npm run validate-enhanced
   npm run build
   pytest scripts/tests/ -v  # when Python tooling is touched
   ```
5. **Review the diff.** Ensure only intentional files changed and no large binaries were added accidentally.
6. **Commit with a descriptive message** (see [Commit Messages](#commit-messages--pull-requests)).
7. **Open a pull request** against `main`, referencing any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #59`).
8. **Respond to feedback promptly.** Reviewers may request adjustments for style, clarity, or tooling.

> **Pre-commit hook:** Husky automatically runs the MyST linter and Python unit tests when you commit. Fix failures before retrying the commit.

## Content and Style Guidelines

- **File locations:** Each chapter lives in `content/ChapXX.../`. Exercises go under `content/ChapXX.../Problems/`.
- **MyST syntax:** Use backtick fences for directives and follow the exact patterns documented in `MYST_CONVENTIONS.md`. Never use `:::` fences.
- **Sections & references:** Add section labels using `(label-name)=` syntax. Keep cross-references on a single line, e.g., `See {ref}`section:lasers``.
- **Figures:** Every figure needs `:name:`, `:width:`, `:align:` (if not center), and a descriptive caption (>20 characters). Use `{numref}` for cross-references.
- **Accessibility:** Write captions that explain what a figure shows and why it matters. Avoid purely decorative images.
- **Equations:** Label equations that are referenced later with `{eq}` labels.
- **Tone:** Maintain an approachable, instructional tone. Avoid slang or colloquialisms.
- **Citations:** Use the existing `references.bib` entries or add new ones when citing external material.

Before submitting, run `npm run validate-enhanced` to catch missing labels, malformed directives, and split references.

---

## Figures and Media

- **Preferred formats:** PNG or JPG for photos; SVG or PNG for diagrams. Avoid WebP (breaks PDF export).
- **Naming convention:** `ChapterNumber_FigureNumber_description.ext` (e.g., `05_03_lens_diagram.png`).
- **Insertion:** Use `python scripts/insert_figure.py` to automate file naming, numbering, and reference updates. If doing it manually, follow the format below:
  ```markdown
  ```{figure} Images/05_03_lens_diagram.png
  :name: fig:lens_diagram
  :width: 80%
  :align: center

  Ray diagram showing how a converging lens focuses parallel rays into the focal plane.
  ```
  ```
- **Optimization:** `npm run build` optimizes images automatically. Do not commit generated `_build/` assets.
- **Unreferenced images:** Run `npm run find-unreferenced-dry` to ensure every image used has a reference.

---

## Tooling & Code Changes

- **Scripts directory:** Python utilities live in `scripts/`. Node scripts for PWA/build tasks also live here. Update `scripts/README.md` when adding or changing behavior.
- **Configuration:** Some scripts rely on `scripts/config.json` (chapter mappings) and `myst.yml` (TOC, exports). Update both when adding chapters or exports.
- **Testing:** Add or update tests in `scripts/tests/` when you change Python utilities. For Node scripts, add practical instructions or unit tests when feasible.
- **Service worker & PWA:** When modifying `service-worker.js` or `manifest.json`, bump cache versions and document changes in the PR description.

---

## Commit Messages & Pull Requests

- **Style:** Use short, imperative descriptions that explain the “why” (e.g., `Add CONTRIBUTING guide for new contributors`).
- **Scope:** One logical change per commit when possible.
- **Reference issues:** Mention relevant issues in commit messages or PR bodies (e.g., `Fixes #59`).
- **Pull request checklist:**
  - [ ] All lint/validation/build commands pass locally
  - [ ] Tests added/updated (when applicable)
  - [ ] Documentation updated (if behavior or workflows changed)
  - [ ] No unrelated files or large binary assets committed
  - [ ] Screenshots or before/after comparisons included for UI or figure changes
